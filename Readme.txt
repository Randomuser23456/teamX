Implemented a solution for End-to-End Digitized Agri-Lending with a focus on automating the lending process for agricultural customers.
Utilized Google Cloud Vision API for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from agricultural land documents.
Employed secure hashing techniques (SHA-256) for sensitive user data such as biometric information and Aadhar numbers to enhance data security.
Utilized a simulated secure user database to store user registration and verification data.
Developed modular and organized code structure with classes to encapsulate different stages of the lending process.
Implemented OTP (One-Time Password) generation and verification mechanism to ensure secure user authentication.
Enabled logging using the logging module to track errors and events, contributing to better troubleshooting and debugging.
Created simulated classes like BankEmployee, UserRegistration, OTPGenerator, and OTPVerifier to model real-world processes.
Implemented a mechanism for land records validation by comparing extracted text with user's biometric and Aadhar data.
Incorporated a placeholder logic to calculate land value using an external API or algorithm.
Executed secure loan disbursement process for eligible users.
Incorporated comprehensive error handling throughout the code to manage unexpected exceptions and provide informative error messages.
Designed the main() function as the central execution point, coordinating various stages of the lending process.
Employed a try-except approach to handle exceptions gracefully, preventing crashes and improving user experience.
Configured logging to capture errors and key events in an application log file for future reference.
Created a mechanism to catch and log errors during the main execution to enhance visibility into issues.
Established a user-friendly interface by providing clear status messages for each stage of the lending process.
Integrated code execution within a conditional _main_ block to ensure it runs when the script is executed directly.
Enhanced application robustness by capturing and logging errors occurring during main execution.
